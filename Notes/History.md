# History behind Table Transfer Tool
## ü§î Scenario
Suppose your boss hands you an Excel "database" of 10'000 rows, and a second spreadsheet that needs to be updated. How would you go about this task?

"`VLOOKUP`" the seasoned Excel boffin might say. 

However, you then need to ensure that every row in your destination found match in the source, via filtering for `#N/A`. Easy enough. But what if there were duplicate keys in the source? Now you need to use Conditional Formatting to Highlight Duplicates, then Filter by that colour. And what if you require all the keys in the source to be present in the destination - what if new rows were added? Now you need to perform the same `VLOOKUP`, but in the opposite direction.

And how do you handle blank cells? Do you just Paste as Value, then Search & Replace for zero (entire cell) into a blank?

Let's spice things up a bit more: what if you have an existing column, and only want to `VLOOKUP` the blank cells? Now you need to `VLOOKUP` to a second column, perform IF conditionals, then update the original column. 

Or what if you want to update all the values, but keep track of which ones changed? Or perhaps you are updating from an incomplete source, and do not want blanks in there to overwrite data you already have? Or perhaps the author applied some filters, and you are only instructed to update the filtered rows: do you Select Visible and copy to a new temporary sheet?

What would your solution be if you had to perform this task with not one column, but ten? Or twenty? And what if it was not just one source spreadsheet, but a dozen? The smart thing would be to consolidate the source sheets and then combine them - but what if you had a deadline and can't wait for the last straggler?

The obvious solution would be to invest in a *Real‚Ñ¢* database, but unfortunately, for many this is not an option. And thus, this project was born.

## üóÉÔ∏è Background
At work we spend a lot of time using `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, and other techniques such as `INDEX(MATCH())` to copy data between spreadsheets. 

Some of the issues we faced were:

1. Having to manually confirm that all keys were present in both sheets.
2. Ensuring that each key appeared exactly once in each sheet.
3. Incremental updates ‚Äî i.e., only updating cells in the destination sheet which were originally blank.
4. Ignoring blank cells in the source sheet ‚Äî i.e., not replacing existing data in the destination sheet with blank cells from the source sheet.
5. Having to do the above for multiple columns, which are not necessarily in the same order, or with the same name.
6. Having to repeat the above process multiple times, every day.
